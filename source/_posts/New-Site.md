Well now. Here we are again. This must be what, the fourth fresh site I've started? They've all eventually gone to the mists of time. For a time I was using [Postleaf](1) on my Raspberry Pi as a blog, but that didn't go well. I'll probably move over my post about the World Scout Jamboree to this site as well, so that post may appear before this one chronologically.

The goal for this incarnation is long-term stability. I don't want to have to reinstall another CMS in a few months. That just gets weird. I also don't want to have to hand code my site, that's not my cup of tea. I build desktop applications and games, not websites.

A little bit about me: As of writing I'm a Life Scout in the Boy Scouts of America. I'm very close to earning my Eagle, with only Hiking, Personal Fitness, and Family Life to go. I believe wholeheartedly in the importance of public service, and I try and provide as much as I can, through my skills with amateur radio and coordinating events for local organizations. I currently work as a student lighting designer and sound technician at my school for outside shows and events. I play the euphonium in the school concert band. In my spare time I write roguelikes and Discord bots.
